Running code:
python text_segment_classification.py

Assumptions:
It assumes that the data is in "segment/segment.data.train"
It also assumes that the blank spaces are labelled #BLANK#

For this assignment I used python's scikit-learn package.
The learning algorithm I used was RandomForestClassifier
Features I used for the feature vector:
1.  spaces to length ratio
2.  number to length ratio
3.  alphabet to length ratio
4.  uppercase letters to length ratio
5.  check if the chunk has the same number of leading spaces
6.  number of periods
7.  ratio of punctuation characters to alphabet characters
8.  sentence starts with this quotation special characters
9.  first two characters are "--"
10. it has a number at the beginning
11. starts with "in article"
12. number of capitalized first characters in a string to words ratio
13. average spaces between words
14. last character is a period
15. average number of words per line
16. number of lines the segment consists of

To test the training data I divided it into 60% train & 40% test.
Like suggested in the assignment I divided it into segments of same labels
and print out based on the number of segments and not lines.

Results:
Since it's a randomforestm, the results vary slightly for each run
{'GRAPHIC': 0, 'QUOTED': 3, 'NNHEAD': 0, 'ITEM': 8, 'SIG': 12, 'ADDRESS': 0, 'PTEXT': 8, 'TABLE': 11, 'HEADL': 1}
### HW1B ykim160 - OVERALL CORRECT: 353 = 89.14%	INCORRECT: 43 = 10.86%

{'GRAPHIC': 0, 'QUOTED': 3, 'NNHEAD': 0, 'ITEM': 6, 'SIG': 13, 'ADDRESS': 0, 'PTEXT': 7, 'TABLE': 9, 'HEADL': 1}
### HW1B ykim160 - OVERALL CORRECT: 357 = 90.15%	INCORRECT: 39 = 9.85%

{'GRAPHIC': 0, 'QUOTED': 1, 'NNHEAD': 0, 'ITEM': 7, 'SIG': 13, 'ADDRESS': 0, 'PTEXT': 10, 'TABLE': 9, 'HEADL': 1}
### HW1B ykim160 - OVERALL CORRECT: 355 = 89.65%	INCORRECT: 41 = 10.35%

For testing purposes I printed the top line out to see what label my model was missing the most. (commented out)
As the results show most of the erros are on SIG, TABLE, ITEM, PTEXT.
Identifying features for SIG is really difficult because it varies a lot.
TABLE and ITEM were not as easily identifiable despite having features that are specific to them.
PTEXT didn't really have specific features that defined it.

The accuracy can be higher if we print by lines and not by segments since each mistake reduces
the correctness by a lot.
