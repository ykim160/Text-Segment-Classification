Running code:
python end-of-sentence-detection.py

Assumptions:
It assumes that the data is called "sent.data.train" and is in the same directory
Uses data in "classes/abbrevs", "classes/titles", and "classes/sentence_internal"

For this assignment I used python's scikit-learn package.
The learning algorithm I used was RandomForestClassifier
Features I used for the feature vector:
1.  left word is an EOS word
2.  left word is in the abbreviation list
3.  left word is in the titles list
4.  left word is in the sentence internal list
5.  word before is shorter than 3 letters
6.  the first letter of the word before sentence is uppercase
7.  word after sentence is uppercase
8.  left and right words are uppercase
9.  next word starts with a quotation
10. previous word ends with a quotation
11. left side words have more than 1 period
12. left side words contains numbers
13. sentence is smaller than 1 word
14. left side words have length of one

To test the training data I divided it into 70% train & 30% test.

Results:
Since it's a randomforestm, the results vary slightly for each run

### HW1A ykim160 - OVERALL CORRECT: 13449 = 99.61%	INCORRECT: 52 = 0.39%
### HW1A ykim160 - OVERALL CORRECT: 13455 = 99.66%	INCORRECT: 46 = 0.34%
### HW1A ykim160 - OVERALL CORRECT: 13451 = 99.63%	INCORRECT: 50 = 0.37%
